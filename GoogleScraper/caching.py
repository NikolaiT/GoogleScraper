"""
GoogleScraper is a complex application and thus searching is error prone. While developing,
you may need to repeat the same searches several times and you might end up being banned by
the search engine providers. This is why all searches are chached by default.

Every SERP page is cached in a separate file. In the future, it might be more straightforward to
cache scraping jobs in archives (zip files).

What determines the uniqueness of a SERP result?
- The complete url (because there the search query and the params are included)
- The scrape mode: Raw Http might request different resources than a browser does.
- Optionally the http headers (because different User-Agents can yield different results)

Using these three pieces of information would guarantee that we cache only unique requests,
but then we couldn't read back the information of the cache files, since these parameters
are only available at runtime of the scrapers. So we have to be satisfied with the
keyword, search_engine and scrapemode as entropy params.

How does caching work on a higher level?

Assume the user interrupted his scrape job at 1000/2000 keywords and there remain
quite some keywords to scrape for. Then the previously parsed 1000 results are already
stored in the database and shouldn't be added a second time.
